<p>MiRNA Rfam Normalization Corpus was based on the miRNA interaction corpus (MIC) released by Bagewadi et al. which was available at <a href="https://www.scai.fraunhofer.de/en/business-research-areas/bioinformatics/downloads/download-mirna-test-corpus.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>The corpus included the annotations of Rfam IDs to each annotated miRNA mention by two our annotators.</p>

<p>You can download the corpus from <a href="http://127.0.0.1:4000/software/corpus/mic_rfam_v1.0.zip">here</a></p>

<h1 id="mri-web-service">MRI web service</h1>

<p>A REST (Representational State Transfer) web service for our miRNA identification component was implemented according to the protocol defined by the BeCalm (Biomedical annotation meta-server) platform.</p>

<p>The service can be accessed from the website of <a href="http://www.becalm.eu/">BeCalm</a> or send an access request to <a href="mailto:d00945020@ntu.edu.tw">Dr. Nai-Wun Chang</a></p>
