<p>Identifying patients eligible for clinical trials using electronic health records (EHRs) is a challenging task usually requiring a comprehensive analysis of information stored in multiple EHRs of a patient. The goal of this study is to investigate different methods and their effectiveness in identifying patients that meet specific eligibility selection criteria based on patientsâ€™ longitudinal records. An unstructured dataset released by the n2c2 cohort selection for clinical trials track was used, each of which included 2â€“5 records manually annotated to thirteen pre-defined selection criteria. Unlike the other studies, we formulated the problem as a multiple instance learning (MIL) task and compared the performance with that of the rule-based and the single instance-based classifiers. Our official best run achieved an average micro-F score of 0.8765 which was ranked as one of the top ten results in the track. Further experiments demonstrated that the performance of the MIL-based classifiers consistently yield better performance than their single-instance counterparts in the criteria that require the overall comprehension of the information distributed among all of the patientâ€™s EHRs. Rule-based and single instance learning approaches exhibited better performance in criteria that donâ€™t require a consideration of several factors across records. This study demonstrated that cohort selection using longitudinal patient records can be formulated as a MIL problem. Our results exhibit that the MIL-based classifiers supplement the rule-based methods and provide better results in comparison to the single instance learning approaches.</p>
