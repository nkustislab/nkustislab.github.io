<p>Entity linking (EL) is the task of linking a textual named entity mention to a
knowledge base entry. Traditional approaches have addressed the problem by
dividing the task into separate stages: entity recognition/classification, entity
filtering, and entity mapping, in which different constraints are used to improve the
system’s performance. Nevertheless, these constraints are executed separately and
cannot be used interactively. In this paper, we propose an integrated solution to the
task based on a Markov logic network (MLN). We show how the stage decision
can be formulated and combined in an MLN. We conducted experiments on the
biomedical EL task, gene mention linking (GML), and compared our model’s
performance with those of two other GML approaches. Our experimental results
provide the first comprehensive GML evaluations from three different perspectives:
article-wide precision/recall/F-measure (PRF), instance-based PRF, and question
answering accuracy. This paper also provides formal definitions of all of the above
EL tasks. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the baseline and
state-of-the-art systems under all three evaluation schemes.
