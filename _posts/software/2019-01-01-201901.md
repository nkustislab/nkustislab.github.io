# MiRNA Rfam Normalization Corpus

MiRNA Rfam Normalization Corpus was based on the miRNA interaction corpus (MIC) released by Bagewadi et al. which was available at [here](https://www.scai.fraunhofer.de/en/business-research-areas/bioinformatics/downloads/download-mirna-test-corpus.html).

The corpus included the annotations of Rfam IDs to each annotated miRNA mention by two our annotators. 

You can download the corpus from [here]({{ site.url }}/software/corpus/mic_rfam_v1.0.zip)

# MRI web service

A REST (Representational State Transfer) web service for our miRNA identification component was implemented according to the protocol defined by the BeCalm (Biomedical annotation meta-server) platform. 

The service can be accessed from the website of [BeCalm](http://www.becalm.eu/) or send an access request to [Dr. Nai-Wun Chang](mailto:d00945020@ntu.edu.tw)
