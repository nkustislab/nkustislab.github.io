A REST (Representational State Transfer) web service for the developed miRNA identification component was implemented according to the protocol defined by the BeCalm (Biomedical annotation meta-server) platform. Our RESTful service consists of three major components. The first is the data retrieval component which can retrieve articles from remote data sources. In our current implementation, four data sources are supported. Two of the data sources are PubMed Central and PubMed fetched by using the NCBI E-utilities. The other two are the pattern server and the abstract server released in the BioCreative V.5 technical interoperability and performance of annotation servers (TIPS) task.
