## Abstract

Over the past decade, many biomedical information extraction tools have been developed. Some of these tools are provided with access via web services. However, many of these tools are not interoperable with web services performance not evaluated.  In this study, we implemented and evaluated the performance of an interoperable web service that annotates disease entities called Disease Extract Annotation Server (DEAS). The DEAS evaluation was carried out over a period of two months. Interoperability, stability, speed and batch processing capabilities of DEAS were evaluated. DEAS was able to process documents from multi data sources and types with response times varying from one second to six seconds per document.  The performance evaluation assisted in improving the underlying CRF-based disease entity recognition pipeline. In future, we would like to support more data format standards and also improve DEAS performance by employing distributed and parallel processing techniques.
