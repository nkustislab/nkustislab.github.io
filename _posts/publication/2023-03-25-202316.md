## Abstract

Extensive use of social media for communication has made it a desired resource in human behavior intensive tasks like product popularity, public polls and more recently for public health surveillance tasks such as lifestyle associated diseases and mental health. In this paper, we exploited Twitter data for detecting pregnancy cases and used tweets about pregnancy to study trigger terms associated with maternal physical and mental health. Such systems can enable clinicians to offer a more comprehensive health care in real time. Using a Twitter-based corpus, we have developed an ensemble Long-short Term Memory (LSTM) – Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) network representation model to learn legitimate pregnancy cases discussed online. These ensemble representations were learned by a SVM classifier, which can achieve F1-score of 95% in predicting pregnancy accounts discussed in tweets. We also further investigate the words most commonly associated with physical disease symptoms ‘Distress’ and negative emotions ‘Annoyed’ sentiment. Results from our sentiment analysis study are quite encouraging, identifying more accurate triggers for pregnancy sentiment classes.
