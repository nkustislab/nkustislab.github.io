## Abstract

Like the stock market, cryptocurrency prices can be affected by world events such as war, trade wars, natural disasters and terrorism. Due to the rapid and large-scale dissemination of Twitter messages, the collective mood associated with cryptocurrency investments is generated by a large number of personal sentiments in the messages. In particular, for cryptocurrency such a sentiment is not only representing the common investment flavor in the market, but also affecting individual investment behavior and, even the entire cryptocurrency marketing performance. Motivated by this, in this work we utilized the collected Twitter big-data in recent years to develop a machine learning approach and algorithm for exploring the dynamics of Bitcoin price. Our goal is to find the correlation between the social sentiments related specific world events and the trends of Bitcoin price fluctuations. Hence, in this work we have established an event-driven Bitcoin investment model and conducted empirical research in a case study to analyze the impact of major global events on bitcoin price volatility
