# About the lab 
## ISLab 
Welcome to the Intelligent Systems Lab! Our team specializes in data mining, machine learning, and natural language processing, with a focus on the biomedical and molecular biology domains. Our goal is to unlock insights hidden in vast unstructured data through the use of advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence and computer vision.

### Research
Our lab is actively involved in several projects related to clinical natural language processing, bio-text mining, and social media mining. We are committed to advancing the field of biomedical research and improving patient outcomes through our work.

### Biomedical Text Mining
We extract knowledge nuggets from texts and literature in the biomedical and molecular biology domain.

### Clinical Natural Language Processing
* We extract and structure clinically-relevant outcomes from clinical texts to aid decision support.

### Social Media Mining
* We extract, analyze, and visualize patterns and trends from social media data.

### Computer Vision
* We enable computers to understand what they see.

## Project
* Here are our current active projects:

### 去識別化工具 (Clinical Natural Language Processing)
* 癌症研究跨機構合作平台及其整合應用 (Clinical Natural Language Processing)
* 人工智慧導入肺癌早期偵測與癌症登記之研發 (Clinical Natural Language Processing)
* MET NETWORK IN PUBMED (Bio-Text Mining)
* LIVERCANCERMARKERRIF (Bio-Text Mining)

## Software
We have developed several software tools, such as:

* MRI - MicroRNA Identification: A RESTful web service for identifying miRNAs from literature and a corpus for miRNA identification.
* SPRENO: A BioC module for identifying organism terms in figure captions.
* NTTMUCLINICAL.NET: A set of C# libraries developed for processing discharge summaries.
* T-HOD: A literature-based candidate gene database for hypertension, obesity, and diabetes.
* PUBMED-EX: A web browser extension to enhance PubMed search with text mining features.
* BIOSMILE WEB SEARCH: A web-based PubMed-like search application powered with semantic analysis.
